![Terraform](https://kodekloud.com/certificate-verification/2D11E9A45637-2DEA8399D847-2D11E37145E9/)


This project demonstrates the use of Terraform for Infrastructure as Code (IaC), Ansible for configuration management, and OpenSCAP for security compliance, integrated into a CI/CD pipeline. Showcasing automated, secure infrastructure deployment on GitHub.

## Project Structure

- **README.md**: Project documentation.
- **terraform/**: Contains Terraform configurations for AWS resources.
  - **main.tf**: Main Terraform configuration file.
  - **variables.tf**: Terraform variables.
  - **outputs.tf**: Terraform outputs.
- **ansible/**: Ansible playbooks and roles.
  - **playbooks/**: Ansible playbooks for configuring EC2 instances.
  - **roles/**: Reusable Ansible roles for specific configurations.
- **openscap/**: OpenSCAP scan definitions and policies.
- **.github/workflows/**: CI/CD pipeline configurations for GitHub Actions.

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Project Setup

[] **Initialize a new Git repository.**
   ```bash
   git init Automated-IaC-with-Security-Compliance
   cd Automated-IaC-with-Security-Compliance
   ```

######### Create the project structure. ###############
```bash
mkdir -p terraform ansible openscap .github/workflows
touch README.md terraform/{main.tf,variables.tf,outputs.tf} ansible/playbooks/main.yml
```
[] **Terraform Implementation**

Define your AWS infrastructure in terraform/main.tf.
Specify any necessary variables in terraform/variables.tf.
Define output variables in terraform/outputs.tf.

[] **Ansible Configuration**

Create Ansible playbooks in ansible/playbooks/.
Define roles for web, app, and database configurations in ansible/roles/.

[] **Security Compliance with OpenSCAP**

Add OpenSCAP scan definitions in the openscap/ directory.
Integrate OpenSCAP scans into the CI/CD pipeline for automated compliance verification.

[] **CI/CD Pipeline Configuration**

Configure GitHub Actions in .github/workflows/main.yml to automate:
Terraform deployment.
Ansible configurations.
OpenSCAP compliance scans.

**Documentation**

Document the architecture, setup, and instructions in README.md.
This project is not only a demonstration of your technical skills but also your commitment to security and compliance in infrastructure deployment.

[] Ensure each command and configuration step is thoroughly tested and documented.
